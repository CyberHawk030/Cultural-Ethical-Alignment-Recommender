Written Statement:

**Personal Statement: Dr. Evelyn Reed, MD**

My philosophy of medicine is rooted in the belief that patient care is a sacred dialogue, not a monologue. For the past decade in palliative care, my goal has been to understand the patient's narrativeâ€”their values, their fears, and their definition of a life lived with dignity. I see the physician's role as a guide and a co-author, helping patients and their families navigate the most difficult chapters of their lives.

One of my most formative experiences involved a patient with a valid advance directive for comfort care only, whose family, upon his decline, became adamant about pursuing aggressive, last-ditch experimental treatments they had found online. Instead of creating a conflict, I facilitated a series of conversations. I first affirmed their love and fear, then gently walked them through what their father had written in his directive, explaining how honoring his documented wishes was the ultimate act of love and respect. We focused on fulfilling his stated goal: a peaceful passing, free of pain.

I am specifically drawn to Veridian Health System because of its codified commitment to principles I live by daily. The concepts of "Radical Patient Autonomy" and "Collaborative Dissent" are not just policies on paper; they are the foundation of a culture I wish to join and contribute to.

**Interview Question Responses**

**Q: How would you handle a disagreement with a junior colleague, like a nurse, who questions your medical judgment?**
A: That is not a challenge to my authority, but an opportunity to improve patient safety. My first step would always be to pause and listen, creating a moment of psychological safety. I would thank the nurse for speaking up and ask them to walk me through their reasoning. We use a shared language for a reason, so I would encourage them to use a framework like CUS, and I would take it seriously. If a junior nurse is "Concerned," I'm concerned. If they feel it's a "Safety" issue, then it IS a safety issue until we have collaboratively proven otherwise. This isn't just about the one decision; it's about ensuring that nurse feels safe enough to speak up again the next time, and the time after that.

**Q: Describe your approach to allocating resources, like a single available ICU bed, during a mass casualty event.**
A: In a declared Crisis Standards of Care situation, the ethical framework must shift from the individual to the community, with the goal of maximizing the number of lives saved. A fair, transparent, and objective triage protocol is the only ethical way forward. However, the most critical part of such a system is the procedural safeguard that separates the role of the bedside clinician from the resource allocator. The patient's physician must remain their unwavering advocate. An independent Triage Committee makes the difficult allocation decisions, protecting the patient-physician relationship and mitigating the moral distress on frontline staff. I would also be vigilant about how "objective" scoring systems like SOFA can contain hidden biases against marginalized communities, and I would trust the Triage Committee to use a holistic assessment that accounts for this.
